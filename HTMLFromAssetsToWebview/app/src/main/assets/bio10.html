<h3> The Respiratory System and Gas Exchange  </h3> 


<p>Cellular respiration is the breakdown of organic molecules to form ATP. Enough supply of oxygen is needed for the aerobic respiratory machinery of Kreb's Cycle and the Electron Transport System to effectively translate stored organic energy into energy rapt in ATP.
	
	</p>
<p>
	 Carbon dioxide is as well manufactured through the metabolism of the cell and ought to be expelled from the cell. There ought to be an exchange of gases: carbon dioxide departing from the cell, oxygen entering the cell.
	 
	 </p>
<p>
	  Animals possess organ systems concerned with the facilitation of this exchange in addition to the transport of gases to and from exchange areas. 
</p>

<h3> Bodies and Respiration </h3>  


<p>Single-celled organisms substitute gases unswervingly across their cell membrane. Nevertheless, the slow rate of diffusion of oxygen as compared to carbon dioxide put a limit to the size of single-celled organisms. 
	
	</p>
<p>
	All simple animals that do not possess specialized exchange surfaces possess flattened, tubular, or thin shaped body structures, which are the main effective one for exchange of gases. Nevertheless, these uncomplicated animals are quite small in size. 
</p>

<p>Large animals cannot preserve gas exchange by diffusion across their outer surface. They developed a selection of respiratory surfaces that all enlarge the surface area for exchange, thereby permitting giving room for broader bodies. 
	
	</p>
<p>
	A respiratory surface is enveloped with thin, soggy epithelial cells that permit oxygen and carbon dioxide to be exchanged. Those gases can only pass through the cell membranes when they are melted in water or an aqueous solution; this means that all respiratory surfaces ought to be moist. 
</p>


<h3> Methods of Respiration  </h3> 

<p>Single-celled organisms exchange gases straightforwardly crosswise their cell membrane. Sponges and jellyfish for example do not have special organs for gas exchange and they obtain gases directly from the nearby water. 
	
	</p>
<p>
	Flatworms and annelids make use of use their outer surfaces for gaseous exchange. Arthropods, annelids, and fish make use of gills; terrestrial vertebrates make use of internal lungs.
 </p>



<h3> The Body Surface respiration known as cutaneous respiration </h3> 


<p>Flatworms and annelids make use of their outer surfaces for gaseous exchange. Earthworms possess a series of thin-walled blood vessels referred to as capillaries. Gas exchange takes place at capillaries located all through the body in addition to those in the respiratory surface. 
</p>

<h3> Gills </h3> 


<p>Gills to a great extent increase the surface area for exchange of gases. They are present in a lot of animal groups in addition to the arthropods which includes a lot of some terrestrial crustaceans, annelids, fish, and amphibians. 
	
	</p>
<p>
	Gills characteristically are complicated outgrowths enclosing blood vessels covered by a thin epithelial layer. In general, gills are organized into a series of plates and may be inside the body like in the crabs and fish or outside the body like in amphibians.
</p>

<p>Gills are highly efficacious at eliminating oxygen from water: there is just 1/20 the quantity of oxygen available in water as in an identical volume of air. Water passes through the gills through one direction whereas blood passes in the opposite direction via gill capillaries. This countercurrent movement maximizes the transfer of oxygen.
 </p>


<h3> Tracheal Systems </h3> 

<p>A lot of terrestrial animals posses their respiratory surfaces in the interior part of the body and linked to the outside by a group of tubes. Tracheae are these tubes that transmit air straightforwardly to cells for gas exchange. 
	
	</p>
<p>
	Spiracles are apertures at the body surface that show the way to tracheae that branch into lesser tubes referred to as tracheoles.  The tubes divide repetitively in order to let excessively fine tubules, tracheoles, get to the individual cells or undersized groups of cells inside the body. 
	
	</p>
<p>
	The tracheae will not perform well in animals whose body is longer than 5 cm. 
 </p>    
              
 
<h3> Lungs </h3> 


<p>Lungs are internal growths of the body wall that link to the exterior by a group of tubes and small openings. 
	
	</p>
<p>
	Lung breathing was likely discovered and developed about 400 million years ago. Lungs are not only found in vertebrates, it is as well found in a few types of terrestrial snails possess gaseous exchange structures like those obtained in frogs. 
</p>

<p>Arthropods have open circulatory systems with an outstanding heart in receipt of blood from the hemocoel and pumping it into vessels for circulation to the body. 
	
	</p>
<p>
	Depending on the sort of respiratory organ, the arthropod has, the circulatory system and may or may not be essential movement of oxygen to the body tissues. Those animals that do not necessarily need the blood for the circulation of respiratory gases like insects may not possess a respiratory pigment. 
</p>


<h3> Respiration in invertebrate </h3> 


<h3> Respiratory System Principles </h3>  


<p>1.	The transportation of an oxygen-containing medium so it comes in contact with a moist membrane overlying blood vessels. 
</p>

<p>2.	Diffusion of oxygen from the oxygen containing medium into the blood. </p>


<p>3.	The transportation of oxygen to the tissues and cells of the body. </p>


<p>4.	Diffusion of oxygen from the blood into the cells. </p>


<p>5.	Carbon dioxide traces a path opposite to that of oxygen. </p>

<h3> The Human Respiratory System </h3> 


<p>The Pathway of the human respiratory system involve the following:</p>


<p>•	Air is taken through the nostrils</p>


<p>•	It then travels via the nasopharynx,</p>


<p>•	To the oral pharynx</p>


<p>•	via the glottis</p>


<p>•	into the trachea and</p>


<p>•	into the right and left bronchi, which divides and re-branches into</p>


<p>•	bronchioles, each of which ends in a cluster of</p>


<p>•	alveoli</p>



<p>It is just in the alveoli of the lung that the actual gas exchange occurs. There are a few 300 million alveoli in two adult lungs. These makes available a surface area of a few 160 m2 nearly equal to the singles area of a tennis court and 80 times the area of our skin!
</p>


<h3> Breathing </h3> 


<p>In mammals, the diaphragm splits the body cavity into the</p>


<p>•	abdominal cavity, which possesses the viscera like the stomach and intestines and the
</p>

<p>•	thoracic cavity, which has the heart and lungs.</p>


<p>The inner surface of the thoracic cavity and the outer surface of the lungs are lined with pleural membranes which adhere to each other. If air is introduced between them, the adhesion is broken and the natural elasticity of the lung causes it to collapse.
	
	</p>
<p>
	 This can occur from trauma. And it is sometimes induced deliberately to allow the lung to rest. In either case, re-inflation takes place as the air is slowly absorbed by the tissues.
</p>

<p>Because of this bond, any act that increases the volume of the thoracic cavity makes the lungs to expand, making air to rush into them from the surrounding.
</p>

	<p>During the process of inspiration or inhalation,</p>


	<p>The external intercostal muscles contract, raising the ribs up and out.</p>


	<p>The diaphragm contracts, pulling it down.</p>


	<p>During the process of expiration or inhalation, these processes are repeated and the normal elasticity of the lungs brings them back to their standard volume. At rest, we breathe in air 15–18 times every minute exchanging roughly 500 ml of air.
	</p>

	<p>In more strenuous expiration,</p>


	<p>The inside intercostal muscles pull the ribs down and inward</p>


	<p>The wall of the abdomen contracts causing the stomach and liver to move upward.</p>


<p>Under these conditions, a standard adult male can flush his lungs with roughly 4 liters of air at every breath. This is known as the vital capacity. Even with greatest expiration, roughly 1200 ml of residual air remain.
</p>





<p>Protozoan, porifera and coelenterate  do their gaseous exchange oxygen and carbondioxide, through their body surface. </p>


<p>Platyhelminthes and nemahelminthes exhibit anaerobic respiration. Energy (ATP) is manufactured by glycolysis. Glycogen is further sub-divided into unstable fatty acid, CO 2 and energy. CO 2 is then expelled via body surface.
</p>

<p>ANNELIDA: In annelid, respiratory organ is absent. Gaseous exchange occurs via the skin (cutaneous respiration), gills (branchial respiration), parapodia. Parapodium is extremely involved in (polychaetae) this process.
</p>

<p> Every one of the parapodia possesses a capillary network and is highly supplied with blood. Body wall dorso-ventrally is made up of blood capillaries. 
</p>

<p>Haemocoelomic fluid blood gets their oxygen via the network. Respiratory pigment haemoglobin boosts the intake of oxygen by haemocoelomic fluid. 
</p>

<p>There is no specialized structure in Hirudinae and oligochaetae for exchange of gases but they do by cutaneous respiration.  
</p>


<h3>Arthropoda </h3>   


<p>Aquatic arthropods characteristically possess gills for respiration apart from some exceptionally small species which have no special respiratory structures. Terrestrial arthropods make use of many different respiratory organs; the most exclusive one is the tracheal system. 
	
	</p>
<p>
	There are two types of respiration in arthropods. They are Aquatic respiration and Aerial respiration. 
</p>

<p>Aquatic respiration: This type of respiration makes use of the dissolved oxygen. Aquatic respiration occurs in the following manner:
</p>

<p>Gills are fragile feather-like development of the thoracic appendages like in the palaemon (prawn) and penaeus (scorpion), crab and tracheal gills are present in mayfly, damselfly and stonefly. Larvae have gills (blood gills and book gills) and crustacean via their body surface. Gills are extremely vascularised.
</p>

<p>Aerial respiration: makes use of the oxygen from the air. This type of respiration is obtained in terrestrial arthropods. The respiratory organs are listed below:
</p>

<p>a. Tracheal system ---- mainly found insects, centipedes , millipedes   and a lot of  arachnids.
</p>

<p>b. Book lung ----- is found scorpion. (Extemely vascularised chamber)
</p>

<p>c. simple lung ----- is found in terrestrial coconut crab
</p>

<p>d. Air tube ----- This is found in terrestrial crustacean.</p>



<h3> Summary of respiration in invertebrate </h3> 


<p>1.	Express diffusion of gases to lung, gill and dermal papulae.</p>


<p>2.	Absence of respiratory organ in lower ones but  higher has composite structure for respiration</p>


<p>3.	Express assimilation of o2 but in higher o2 rapt into coelomic fluid then transported to the assorted tissue.</p>


<p>4.	Aquatic take dissolved o2 but higher ones either dissolved o2 or o2 expressively from air.</p>


<p>5.	Those that possess  single respiratory organ are higher than one respiratory organ</p>


<p>The adaptive significance of the variation in the structure of the respiratory organ of organisms living in terrestrial and those in aquatic environments 
</p>

<p>A surface that takes in oxygen ought to be kept moist. This is not an issue for aquatic organisms since they are covered with water. But terrestrial organisms would lose a huge amount of water to the dry air through the process of evaporation from the respiratory surfaces. 
	
	</p>
<p>
	Therefore the majority of terrestrial animals possess their respiratory surfaces inside the body to reduce the loss of water by evaporation. 
</p>

<p>Hard exoskeleton system (arthropods) and scale in reptile are two good examples that illustrate this minimal loss of water.
